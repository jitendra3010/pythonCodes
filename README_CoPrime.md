# Assignment 0102: Coprime
In number theory, two integers a and b are said to be coprime if the only positive integer that divides both
of them is 1.
Write a function coprime_test_loop() that asks the user for two numbers. This function will pass those
two numbers onto a second function coprime(a,b) which will return true or false depending on whether
or not the numbers are coprime. The function coprime_test_loop() will print out a message indicating
the result. It will then ask the user for another pair of numbers and query coprime(a,b) again. It will
continue this loop until the user indicates that they wish to exit the program.
In the code, show at least FIVE interactions with the user with various number combinations (and the
code is outputting the correct answer).
Note: To verify your code is (partially) correct, you can use a coprime calculator such as

Another requirement. In the code, at the top comment section, write your comments on the following
points:
• How efficient is coprime(a,b)? How did you ensure it was not making any needless computations?
• What assumptions does your code make? How easy is it for the user to crash your code?
Submission: Submit the source Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and the exported html file (.html) to the
D2L. Do not zip or archive the file. Your code must include comments at the top including your name,
assignment number, and the honor statement, “I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance
on this assignment.” Each function must include a docstring and be commented appropriately.
