    "#### Logic of Pseudo random number generation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this logic of random number generation we are reading a famous novel and comparing characters to generate  a random number based on 32 bit (custom logic) encryption.\n",
    "* In order to do so we are maintain few variables to traverse the file smoothly in initial and subsequent calls.\n",
    "* like the data for seed, step, startpoint, end point\n",
    "* These variables are initialized along with other when a class object is created.\n",
    "* The random funciton in the class calls the getBitList to get the list of 1's and 0's\n",
    "* the call condition is based on two scenario\n",
    "    * When the call is a 1st call of the object having start position as 0\n",
    "    * when the call is a subsequent call of the object where the start poistion will be the last read position\n",
    "    * If the provided seed value is greater than the end of file then the start position is wrapped to the begining of the file.\n",
    "* Accourding to the above condition the getBitList is called with proper input variables.\n",
    "* The getBitList funcition reads the file and traverse through it to get the charactes and compare them and store 1's or 0's to a list. We ignore the condition when the characters are same.\n",
    "    * The reading logic is based on few condition in order to honor if the run is a 1st run or repeated run for 32 bit generation or if the function is called repeatedly for the same class object.\n",
    "    * It seeks the position to the required spot\n",
    "    * While being in a loop to gather 32 bits it checks the current postion and next position based on condition whether its a 1st run or a subsequent run it gets the characters.\n",
    "    * The logic also handles the case when the end of file is reached in a run based on seed value and step value\n",
    "    * It compares the next position with the end postion and if its beyond the end position it wraps the pointer to exact same number of position that it exceeds from the end.\n",
    "    * It than reads the Char and compares them if the 1st char > 2nd char then 1 is appended to the list else 0.\n",
    "* This received list from the getBitList method is then passed to the calcRandNum to compute the random number.\n",
    "    * Calculation is as such. \n",
    "    * if the list is [1,0,1,1,0.....]\n",
    "    * then calculation is 1*1/2 + 0*1/4 + 1*1/8 + 1*1/16 + 0*1/32 ......\n",
    "* Finally the random number generated is returned back.\n",
