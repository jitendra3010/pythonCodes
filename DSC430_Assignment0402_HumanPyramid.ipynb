    "\n",
    "* Base case of the recursive function ?\n",
    "    - The base case is the person A at the top most level who has no weight on him.\n",
    "* Does everyone in the bottom row carry the same weight? Why or why not? If not, are there any\n",
    "that carry the same weight?\n",
    "    - No everyon in the bottom row do not carry the same weight, because the left most and right most person get weight from only one person from above them while other get weight from two persons above them.\n",
    "    - From the human pyramid of 5 level (row 0-4) provided in the assignment question person L(4,1) and N(4,3) carry the same weight in the bottom row.\n",
    "    - In generic the person beside the left most and right most person carry the same weight , the person beside the center person carry the same weight and if there is no center two person in the center carry the same weight.\n",
    "        - For Ex: At a row level 5 , (5,1) and (5,4) carry the same weight , (5,2) and (5,3) carry the same weight (No Center scenario)\n",
    "        - At a row level 6 , (6,1) and (6,5) carry the same weight, (6,2) and (6,4) carry the same weight , (6,3) is the center that carries the maximum weight."
