    "## Explanation of Approach::\n",
    "**The logic for the program is explained as below**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main function first prints a greeting message.\n",
    "* It then gets the input from the user for the desired size of list and the sum value for which the pair is to be found.\n",
    "* Using the help of list comprehension syntax it creates a list of random numbers based on the size provided by the user.\n",
    "* It performs a sort on the random list using the merge sort technique - Calls the function mergeSort(lst)\n",
    "* This sorted list along with the sum value is sent to the findPairSum funciton to find a pair.\n",
    "* The findPairSum loops through the sorted list calculates the difference of the sum value and the indexed item.\n",
    "* And it performs a binary search to see if the difference number is present in the list or not.\n",
    "* If the binary search returns -1 as the value the findPariSum loop is continued to the next iteration.\n",
    "* If the binary search returns a number then the pair is found and the loop is exited.\n",
    "* This pair is then sent to the printOutput function along with other relevant information for the output message to be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stepwise information is provided inline to the each function**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation w.r.t Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**The complete logic works with a time complexity of O(nlog n)**\n",
    "* The functions which effect the time complexity of the logic are \n",
    "    - mergeSort\n",
    "    - findPairSum\n",
    "    - binarySearch\n",
    "    - printOutput\n",
    "* **mergeSort** - logic does not contain any nested loops, so it is executed with linear complexity.If the array size is doubled, the merge time doubles, too. The total effort is, therefore, the same at all merge levels. So we have n elements times log n division and merge stages. Therefore the time complexity of merge sort is **O(nlog n)**.\n",
    "* **findPairSum** - logic contains a loop which iterates over the list which itself is a time complexity of **O(n)** and within the loop we are calling the binarySearch function which is of time complexity of **O(log n)** (reasoining provided in below point) so the process of findPairSum has a total time complexity of **O(nlog n)** \n",
    "* **binarySearch** - logic does not contain any loop rather it executes the algorith in a recursive manner each time dividing the list of data to half thus exucuting with a time complexity of **O(log n)**\n",
    "* **printOutut** - logic does not contain any loop but it prints the list in the output which itself has a time complexity of **O(n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So accumulating the time complexities of all the effecting function the complete logic of this program runs with a time complexity of O(nlog n)**."
