    " * Function coprime has adopted a algorithm where the 1st number is swapped with 2d number and \n",
    " *    2nd numbers is swapped with modulus value of 1st and 2nd in each iteration till the modulus value is 0 \n",
    " *    Example explaining the logic : a,b = 13,37 \n",
    " *    Iteration 1: (Input a=13 , b=37) , a = b = 37 , b = a%b = 13%37 = 13\n",
    " *    Iteration 2: (Input a=37 , b=13) , a = b = 13 , b = a%b = 37%13 = 11\n",
    " *    Iteration 3: (Input a=13 , b=11) , a = b = 11 , b = a%b = 13%11 = 2\n",
    " *    Iteration 4: (Input a=11 , b=2)  , a = b = 2  , b = a%b = 11%2  = 1\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * The above logic has avoided multiple loop iteration from 0 to max of numbers of 0 to min of numbers\n",
    " * We could have also acheived the output with logic of finding the factors of the numbers individually\n",
    " * And then comparing to see if there are any common factors \n",
    " * But that logic would have required multiple for/while loops\n",

    "###  Hence the logic that we have implemented is more efficient.\n",

    " * Instead of making assumption that the USER will enter positive value numbers\n",
    " * We have implemented try->except in the **coprime_test_loop** function to check if invalid numbers are entered \n",
    " * The user could have broke the logic of the code by enterting negative value or 0\n",
    " * We Assume that the user enters choice of Y and nothing else for the code to execute.\n",
    " * anything Entered other than Y is treated as the customer do not wants to continue"
