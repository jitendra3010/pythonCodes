    "#### How did you iterate through the different dates?\n",

    "#### How did you test if a date was a palindrome date?\n",
    "   * Instead of traversing through each and every single date of a year and chekcing whether they were pallindrome or not, we rather generated pallindrome dates for a given year based on validity.\n",
    "   * For Ex: Given year 2001 -> The pallindrome date for that year will be 10/02/2001\n",
    "   * we first reversed the year 2001 to 1002 , then we got the day as 10 and month as 02 from it.\n",
    "   * after chcecking the validity of the day and the month we concatenated the reversed string with the year again\n",
    "   * so final outcome was 10022001 and while writing it to the file we formatted it as DD/MM/YYY.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where you able to ignore entire months or even years without evaluating every date?\n",
    "   * As per the logic we are not traversing through each and every single dates of a months.\n",
    "   * While chekcing the validity of the day and month if the month do not fall in JAN-DEC we ignore the entire year.\n",
    "   * If the day do not fal under the below conditions we ignore the entire year.\n",
    "       * Day has to be between 1-31\n",
    "       * For Sep/Apr/Jun/Nov it should fall between 1-30\n",
    "       * If its a leap year then we check if the month is feb then the day validity is checked for 1-29\n",
    "       * If no a leap year then the day validity is checked for 1-28\n",
    "   * If the criterias are not met then the entire year is skipped."
