# DSC 430: Python Programming Assignment 0202: Stem-and-Leaf Implementation
Implement your stem-and-leaf plot design from Assignment 0201: Stem-and-Leaf Design.
There are three datafiles provided (‘StemAndLeaf1’, ‘StemAndLeaf2’, ‘StemAndLeaf3’). Interact with the user three times, once for each datafile, and show your code produced correct results (in the exported html file).
Ensure to provide a sufficient amount of documentation/comments in the code. Points of particular importance are
• How (in what data structure) you stored the chart. Is it an efficient way? Can you think of alternative ways?
• How did you obtain the stem and the leaf of a number?
• Can your code handle data with mixed number of digits?
Submission: Submit the source file (.ipynb) and the exported html file (.html) to the D2L. 
Do not zip or archive the file. Your code must include comments at the top including your name, assignment number, and the honor statement, 
“I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment.”
