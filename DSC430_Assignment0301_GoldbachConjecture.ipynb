    "## Execution Flow :: \n",
    " * The main method is called by passing an Interger value for the test.\n",
    " * It First call the printGreeting function to print a message.\n",
    " * It also raises a custome exception if the value is less than equals 3.\n",
    " * It then calls the fetch_goldBach function to test the GoldBach conjecture by passing the value.\n",
    " * The fetch_goldBach function creates a list of prime then iterates over all even numbers of the provided interger value. \n",
    " * It then iterates over all the even integers and calls the getPrimeSum ( **explained later...**) to get the sum of two prime numbers.\n",
    " * Based on the output of the getPrimeSum it creates a dictionary data structure to be sent to print.\n",
    "     * Ex : data structure : {[4,[2,2]], [6,[3,3]], [8,[3,5]], ....}  -> **[key , [list of two prime]],**\n",
    "     *      where keys are even integers and values are list of two prime whose sum is equal to key\n",
    " * The data structure is then sent to printGoldBach function to display the output.\n",
    " * The printGoldBach iterates over the dictionary and prints out the formatted output as expected.\n",
    " \n",
    "**More detail explanation of each code line is provided inline to each functions**\n",
    " \n",
    "## Q: Explain how you find two primes to sum to the given integer. \n",
    "#### We have used function getPrimeSum to get the sum of two prime numbers\n",
    " * The Input to this function are \n",
    "     * list of all prime numbers ( lsPrime ) <= the Integer value provided to main function\n",
    "     * and the integer( target ) value for which the sum is to be fetched \n",
    " * The function first creates an empty lis(resultList)t to hold the result set.\n",
    " * It then holds all the prime numbers in a set( lst_set ) to be used to compare the in the logic below.\n",
    " * It then loops through the list of primes to find the numbers which adds up the target value.\n",
    " * Since the input list are all primes we are sure that the numbers to be found are prime.\n",
    " * Inside the loop we find the difference ( result ) of the target value and the current loop interger \n",
    " * If the result value is present in the set(lst_set) created initialy then both the number and result adds up to target value as they both are present in the prime list.\n",
    " * So both the number are then appended to the empty list created intially.\n",
    " * And immediately the loop is broke becuase we have to find 1st occurance of the two prime adds up to given integer.\n",
    " * At the end of the execution of the complete loop the resultList is sent back to the called function.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Q: Are you hard-coding prime numbers? \n",
    "#### No we are not hard-coding the prime numbers rather we have created a function fetchPrime to get all the prime numbers for the given integer input to the main function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q: Or if you had written a function to generate prime numbers less than n, or to verify if a number is a prime number, do you think your code is efficient?Are there ways to optimize it?\n",
    "#### We have written fetchPrime to get all the prime numbers and a function isPrime to see if the indivual numbers are prime or not\n",
    "   * Yes the code is efficient becuase in the isPrime function we are iterating only through the sqrt of the provided number to reduce the number of iteration and still get the expected output.\n",
    "   * We can also acheive it by below steps\n",
    "      * If the number is divisible by 2, it will return True if the number is equal to 2 else false.\n",
    "      * Now the even numbers are checked since it is divisible by 2, so we just go ahead and check for only odd numbers starting 3 till square root of the this reduces further more iterations.\n",
