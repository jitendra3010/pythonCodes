# Assignment 0101: Grading Logic
NOTE: You create a Jupyter Notebook file for this problem (whatever you name it), and submit the
source file (which has an .ipynb extension) and the exported html file.
Consider the grading logic for this class:
1. If the assignment is not submitted as a Jupyter Notebook file, the grade is 0.
2. If the assignment does not include the author’s name, the grade is 0.
3. If the assignment does not include the assignment number (HW#1 or something similar), the grade
is 0.
4. If the assignment does not include the honor statement, “I have not given or received any
unauthorized assistance on this assignment”, the grade is 0.
5. If the assignment satisfies all of the above conditions...
• Up to ten points are awarded based on the correctness of the code; that is, how well it
meets the given specifications.
• Up to ten points are awarded based on the elegance of the code (data structure selection,
algorithm efficiency, function implementation, etc.).
• Up to ten points are awarded based on the code hygiene (white space, docstrings, etc.).
• Up to ten points are awarded based on the quality of the discussion in the YouTube video.
6. Late assignments lose 1% (of the total points accumulated in the previous steps) per hour.
Write a python function which asks the user a series of questions based on the above logic. For
example, “Did the student include their name?” or “Out of ten points, how would you evaluate the
correctness of the code?”
Notice that if the student did not include their name, there is no reason to ask any more questions.
Likewise, if the assignment was not late, there is no reason to ask how late it was.
The function should return the student’s total score.
In the code file, show the interactions with the user and the output for SIX logistic points mentioned
above.
Submission: Submit the source file (.ipynb) and the exported html file (.html) to the D2L. Do not zip or
archive the file. Your code must include comments at the top including your name, assignment number,
and the honor statement, “I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment.”
Each function must include a docstring and be commented appropriately.
